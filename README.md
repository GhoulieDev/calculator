The Odin Project: Calulator.
A culmination of most of the topics covered in the Foundation section, focusing on HTML/CSS/JS.

Areas of weakness discovered, to be improved/looked into in more depth going forward on future lessons and projects:
- Better Git commit timing and clearer messages
- Creating better in-code comments when/where needed
- Better code structure design via planning ahead and reduction of problem size by breaking into smaller problems
- Practicing how to use the debugger more(both VScode and browser)
- Practice using arrays(with methods) and objects
